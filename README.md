### Hey, you found my work account! ðŸ˜‰

Awesome, It's nice to e-meet you! But there's nothing fancy here, just some minor ideas and tangents if anything. 

ðŸ”­  Instead, checkout my personal account ([@neelrast](https://github.com/neelrast)) for all of my OSS projects.

But since you made it here... Well here's a developer's motto for you:

> We're only gettin' older, baby <br>
> And I've been thinkin' about it lately <br>
> Does it ever drive you crazy <br>
> Just how fast the **main branch**Â changes? <br>
> Everything that you've ever dreamed of <br>
> Disappearing when you wake up <br>
> But there's nothing to be afraid of <br>
> Even when the **main branch**Â changes <br>
> It will never change me and you... ðŸŽ¶
