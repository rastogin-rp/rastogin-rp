### Hello there, found my work account, aye? 👋

🔭 Awesome, It's nice to meet you! But there's nothing fancy here, just some minor ideas and tangets if anything. 
Instead, checkout my personal account ([@neelrast](https://github.com/neelrast)) for all of my OSS projects.

But since you made it here's a developer's motto:

> We're only gettin' older, baby

> And I've been thinkin' about it lately
> 
> Does it ever drive you crazy
> 
> Just how fast the **main branch** changes?
> 
> Everything that you've ever dreamed of
> 
> Disappearing when you wake up
> 
> But there's nothing to be afraid of
> 
> Even when the **main branch** changes
> 
> It will never change me and you... 🎶
